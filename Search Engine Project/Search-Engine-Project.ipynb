mother.\\r\\n\\r\\n250\\r\\n00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:15,364\\r\\nYes, but you know that you and I\\r\\nnearly never met, Yasser.\\r\\n\\r\\n251\\r\\n00:25:17,213 --> 00:25:19,311\\r\\nAnd you were nearly never born.\\r\\n\\r\\n252\\r\\n00:25:21,488 --> 00:25:23,067\\r\\nI was to be buried,\\r\\n\\r\\n253\\r\\n00:25:23,986 --> 00:25:25,383\\r\\nlike my two

time.\\r\\n\\r\\n256\\r\\n00:25:36,522 --> 00:25:38,580\\r\\nWhen the second girl was being...\\r\\n\\r\\n257\\r\\n00:25:41,447 --> 00:25:45,284\\r\\nwhen my father was putting sand over her,\\r\\n\\r\\n258\\r\\n00:25:47,441 --> 00:25:51,038\\r\\nshe took hold of his finger,\\r\\nthe way a baby does.\\r\\n\\r\\n259\\r\\n00:25:52,287 --> 00:25:54,614\\r\\nHe told my mother afterwards,\\r\\n\\r\\n260\\r\\n00:25:55,593 --> 00:25:56,812\\r\\nthat it was a minute...\\r\\n\\r\\n261\\r\\n00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:01,617\\r\\nbefore the tender little grip eased...\\r\\n\\r\\n262\\r\\n00:26:03,625 --> 00:26:05,583\\r\\nand he dared take away his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n263\\r\\n00:26:10,817 --> 00:26:11,866\\r\\nWhen I was born,\\r\\n\\r\\n264\\r\\n00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:15,253\\r\\nmy father ran out of the house\\r\\n\\r\\n265\\r\\n00:26:15,263 --> 00:26:17,330\\r\\nscreaming that he couldn\\'t do it again,\\r\\n\\r\\n266\\r\\n00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:19,448\\r\\nthat he could never do it again.\\r\\n\\r\\n267\\r\\n00:26:21,786 --> 00:26:25,033\\r\\nSumayyah, it is the custom.\\r\\n\\r\\n268\\r\\n00:26:25,742 --> 00:26:26,911\\r\\nBut it\\'s wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\n269\\r\\n00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:32,116\\r\\nThe gods that let such\\r\\nthings be are no gods.\\r\\n\\r\\n270\\r\\n00:26:34,054 --> 00:26:37,280\\r\\nI promised to go to Muhammad\\'s\\r\\nhouse mama, we pray there.\\r\\n\\r\\n271\\r\\n00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:40,807\\r\\nYes!
